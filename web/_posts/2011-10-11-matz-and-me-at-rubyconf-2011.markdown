title: Matz and Me at RubyConf 2011

I had a great time at RubyConf 2011 in New Orleans, LA. I saw old friends from all over the world. I met new friends from all over the world. We laughed and shared our dreams with each other. I gave away a huge pile of [super soft t-shirts](http://store.americanapparel.net/tr401.html "Tri-Blend Short Sleeve Track Shirt"). I heard from many of you a pledge to go back to work and deploy something meaningful on Rubinius in production (more on that soon). 

Oh, and we took these pictures of me and Matz in the new Rubinius shirt. Altogether, not a bad conference at all.

How was *your* RubyConf?
