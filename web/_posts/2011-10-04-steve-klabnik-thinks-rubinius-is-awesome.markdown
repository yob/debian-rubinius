title: Steve Klabnik Thinks Rubinius is Awesome
author: Shane Becker

Steve Klabnik [added support for `require_relative` to Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/pull/1184). He documents his process and [how much fun he had](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/10/04/rubinius-is-awesome.html "Rubinius Is Awesome - Literate Programming"). We're glad to hear that Steve thinks Rubinius is awesome. Making Rubinius awesome for rubyists has always been one of our core tenets.

> Even if I didn’t have some code to look at, because Rubinius is just Ruby,
> it was really easy to dive in and check out the code, because it’s all Ruby.
> Seriously. Rubinius is just Ruby. Just Ruby. Ruby.

> So dive in and add some features today! If having an awesome alternate Ruby implementation
> isn’t enough for you, the rbx team will bribe you with special stickers for committers, and sweet 
> black-on-black tshirts for people with 10 commits or more!
