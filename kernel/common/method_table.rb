# Holds Executables for lookup by the VM.
#
# When looking up an Executable, Rubinius starts at the real class (the object
# in the class slot of the receiver) and looks in its MethodTable for the
# method name.  If the method is not found the ancestors list will be
# walked looking for the method.
#
# If no method was found, Rubinius restarts at the real class looking for
# "method_missing", walking the ancestors list if it is not found.
#
# If "method_missing" is not found, a VM assertion is triggered.
